# Meetup2

For our second meetup we use two projects as showcases for "Plug".
You will find both projects in the apps-folder

#### 1. phonix
Phonix is a simple showcase, where we create our own routing and plugs with Plug.

#### 2. bakery
Bakery is a phoenix-based cookie-manipulation. We create our first route through a controller and a view, add some jquery-magic and plug our cookie-bakery-plug into the route.

#### slides are available here:  [meetup@Aachen](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wrQmkAdyy60ZyKYm6WAdtwnHKMM5Of3tAPwRceeq6sQ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000)
